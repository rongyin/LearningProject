# 敏捷开发
敏捷开发以用户的需求进化为核心，采用迭代、循序渐进的方法进行软件开发。
在敏捷开发中，软件项目在构建初期被切分成多个子项目，各个子项目的成果都经过测试，具备可视、可集成和可运行使用的特征。换言之，就是把一个大项目分为多个相互联系，但也可独立运行的小项目，并分别完成，在此过程中软件一直处于可使用状态。

# workflow
user story(backlog==demand) -> planning meeting -> sprint backlog -> separate tasks,ETA,Priority,plan for iterate->develop->test->release

Scrum is just one of the many iterative and incremental agile software development process 
that allows us to focus on delivering the business value in the shortest time.
- Scrum team
Scrum team (aka. Development team) is formed with from 3 to 9 people who MUST fulfill all technical needs to deliver 
the product or the service. They will be guided directly by the Scrum Master, but they will not be directly managed. 
They must be self-organized, versatile, and responsible enough to complete all required tasks.
The development team is responsible for delivering potentially shippable product increments every sprint from analysis, 
design, development, testing, to technical writing and etc. It is extremely important for Scrum team possesses 
the following characteristics:

- Agile is a term used to describe approaches to software development emphasizing incremental delivery, team collaboration, continual planning, and continual learning, 
instead of trying to deliver it all at once near the end.
* Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
* 业务人员和开发人员必须相互合作
* 经常地交付可工作的软件,相隔几星期或一两个月，倾向于采取较短的周期
